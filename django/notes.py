# FUll stack (fron-end + back-end technologies)
# Front-end - what you see as a user on the website
# Back-end - technology used to decide what to show on the Front-End
# what pictures to retrieve from DB.

# Front End:
# - HTML - structure of the page (check via "view page")
# - CSS - styling of the website (colors, fonts)
# - JS - add interactivity to the website

# Back End:
# - Language (php, node.js, ruby/rails, java, python)
# - Framework (django)
